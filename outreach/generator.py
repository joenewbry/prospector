I'm reaching out to the {contact_role} at {name}. I'm building Memex ({MEMEX_GITHUB}) — open source continuous screen history — and I'd like to offer it completely free to all {name} students.

Here's why I think it's a fit for {name} specifically: {pitch}.

The idea is simple — students run Memex during their {programs} coursework, and it creates a verifiable, timestamped record of their entire learning journey. After graduation, instead of just a certificate and a portfolio, they have proof of how they actually work: debugging sessions, design decisions, the messy real process that employers want to see.

For {name} ({size}, {locations}), this could be a differentiator for your graduates in a competitive market.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this makes sense as a student tool?
